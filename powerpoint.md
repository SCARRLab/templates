This one is a bit more complicated. This [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-the-default-font-in-powerpoint-8e93c947-c160-4310-8070-afea7da78c33) outlines the whole process (if you want to make your own). 

1. Download "kTNR.ptox" from the "files" folder in this repo. 
2. Save as a powerpoint template to C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\Custom Office Templates.
3. When oepning/creating a new powerpoint, navigate to "New" and then select kTNR from Personal section.
