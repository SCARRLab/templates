This one is the easiest. This [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-the-default-font-in-word-2f50603b-9886-47e4-a483-48ac5ab80163) summarizes everything.

If you are too lazy to click the link, that's ok, here is the information you bum. 

1. Go to Home, and then select the Font Dialog Box Launcher.
2. Select the font and size you want to use. 
3. Select **Set As Defualt**.
4. Select "All documents based on the the Normal template".
5. Select OK twice.

This will make it such that now every time you open/create a new word document, the font and size will be as you just specified. I recommend 12pt Times New Roman as it is most common and nobody can get offended by it.
